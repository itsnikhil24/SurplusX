## 🥁 Introduction
SurplusX is a smart food surplus management platform designed to reduce food wastage from restaurants and events.

Every day restaurants waste large amounts of food due to overproduction, cancellations, and unsold items. Instead of letting this food go to waste, SurplusX provides a platform where restaurants can:

- Sell surplus food

- Donate surplus food

- Reduce waste

- Earn money

- Help NGOs and needy people

The system intelligently decides whether the food should be sold or donated using a Smart Allocation Algorithm.

This helps:

- Reduce food wastage
- Help NGOs
- Help poor communities
- Save environment
- Increase restaurant profits

## 💡 Inspiration
Food wastage is one of the biggest global problems.

Restaurants and large events waste huge quantities of food every day while many people go hungry.

We wanted to build a system that:

- Prevents food waste

- Helps NGOs

- Helps restaurants earn money

- Uses smart technology to automate decisions

SurplusX connects Restaurants → Buyers → NGOs in one platform.

## 💬 What it Does
SurplusX is a platform that helps restaurants reduce food waste by allowing them to sell or donate surplus food.

It uses a smart allocation system that analyzes expiry date, quantity, and location to automatically decide whether the food should be sold in the marketplace or donated to nearby NGOs.

This helps restaurants earn money, reduce waste, and support people in need.

## ❗ Challenges We Faced 

- Building a smart allocation algorithm based on expiry date, quantity, and location.
- Implementing real-time NGO allocation for surplus food.
- Managing secure authentication and role-based dashboards (Restaurant, NGO, Admin).
- Handling location-based matching between restaurants and NGOs.
